error: failed to push some refs to 
'https://github.com/devindushanek/Resume-Studio.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains 
work that you do not
hint: have locally. This is usually caused by another 
repository pushing to
hint: the same ref. If you want to integrate the remote 
changes, use
hint: 'git pull' before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push 
--help' for details.
